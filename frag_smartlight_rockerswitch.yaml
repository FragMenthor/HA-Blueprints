  name: Smart Rocker Switch for virtual control of Smart Light
  description: >
    Blueprint to control a smartlight that is always connected to power with a tradicional rocker switch equiped with a smartmodule.
    Operation:
      - If the light is OFF, one comutation will turn ON;
      - If the light is ON, 1 comutation withing specified time will turn OFF;
      - If the light is ON, and there are 2 comutations withing specified time, it will cycle between 3 brightness settings: 50% → 95% → 50% → 5% → 50% → ...
